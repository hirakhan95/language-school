    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">1. Will I cover all important language skills?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes. We have varying types of lessons that each focus on a different language competency: Speaking, Conversational Skills, Grammar, Vocabulary, Reading and Writing. With these skills, you will be able to speak with confidence in any situation, understand native-speakers from across the globe and feel comfortable building simple to complex sentence structures.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">2. Up to what level can I learn?</div>
        <div class="answer">We currently offer English and German from A1 – B2. </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">3. What learning materials will I get?</div>
        <div class="answer">You can download the class materials for free and use them at any time. After your class, you will also find a quiz to help you refresh and practice your new skills. For English and A1 German students, downloadable exercises are available as well. All materials are uniquely created by Maxtergo experts to align with CEFR standards.

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">4. Who are the teachers?</div>
        <div class="answer">Learning a language takes more than just following a curriculum. All of our teachers are certified, qualified and have a history of teaching excellence. Teaching is not their hobby, it’s their career.
        </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">5. What happens in a class?</div>
        <div class="answer">After scheduling a class on our platform, you will be able to join the class with 2-4 fellow students from around the world. The teacher will introduce themselves and begin teaching the lesson using learning materials that you can download at the end of class. During the class, we encourage you to interact not only with the materials and the teacher but also with the students. Towards the end of class, the teacher will recap the lesson and ensure everybody has understood the lesson.</div>
    
        <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">6. Is Maxtergo a language learning app?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, we are not a language learning app. We are an online language school. And like any school, we offer live classes with certified, native speaker teachers. At Maxtergo, we believe that nothing can replace live interaction and customized feedback from a real person.</div>
